PDF Text-to-Speech Converter
This is a Python script that converts the text of a PDF file to speech using the PyPDF2 and pyttsx3 libraries. The script reads a PDF file and extracts the text from each page, then uses text-to-speech technology to read the text aloud.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run this script, you will need to install the PyPDF2 and pyttsx3 libraries. You can install them using pip:

Copy code
pip install PyPDF2 pyttsx3
You will also need to have a PDF file that you want to convert to speech.

Running the Script
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located.

Make sure that the PDF file you want to convert is in the same directory.

Run the script using the following command:

Copy code
python pdf_to_speech.py
The script will prompt you to enter the name of the PDF file. Enter the name of the file (including the file extension) and press Enter.

The script will start reading the text of the PDF file aloud.
